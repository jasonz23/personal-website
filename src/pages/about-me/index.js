          Welcome to my personal website!
          <br />
          <br />
          My name is Jason Zhao and in my free time, I enjoy a variety of
          hobbies.
          <br />
          I have a passion for tennis and have been competing since I was 14
          years old. When I'm not on the court, I enjoy expressing my creativity
          through art. I've taken art classes for over 5 years and find it to be
          a relaxing and fulfilling way to spend my time.
          <br />
          Additionally, I have a knack for programming and love to create cool
          websites which you can check out in my projects tab.
          <br />
          <br />
          Whether I'm hitting a tennis ball, drawing, or coding, I'm always
          pushing myself to improve and learn new skills. Thank you for visiting
          my website and I hope you enjoy learning more about me!
